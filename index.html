                                <p>after receiving a sundae flowers package filled with mochi gummies for my birthday, i wondered <b>what would happen if sundae school decided to create a cbd-powered tiger balm?</b> together with my partner at quiet tuesday, we conceptualized what this tiger balm would look like, how it would appeal to the consumer, and how to market it based on sundae school's current marketing strategy.</p>
                                <p>based on sundae school's lighthearted, playful, and snappy tone, i came up with the slogan, <b>"not your mom's tiger balm"</b> to pay homage to asian moms who use tiger balm as a remedy for when we were sick, while tying in sundae school's mission to destigmatize marijuana in the asian community.</p>

                                    <p>to reflect changes in the social realm, nola was due for a website lift. i reimagined and worked with our web designer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thecapitalv/">Victoria</a>, to conceptualize nola's website navigation, and various pages along the site to help promote new and cult-favorite products.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>the process</h4>
                                    <p>there were a few variables that needed to be included in this website redesign: push customers towards new and cult-favorite products, highlight our skin quizzes, and most importantly, showcase how nola's products can help give you the glowiest skin of your dreams.</p>
                                    <p>previously, the navigation bar showcased every single one of nola's products, which created a lack of hierarchy.</p>

                                    <h4>the process</h4>
                                    <p>the goal for this campaign was simple: push our customers to shop in-app. the sale offered two things: free shipping on intimate products over $40, with a mystery freebie.</p>
                                    <p>on the email side, we sent emails to preexisting customers to let them know that if they shopped in-app, there would be a mystery gift waiting for them in their cart. on the social side, we created social media posts that alluded to our exciting sale.</p>

                                <p>in their previous framework, unnecessary and repetitive categories made their content inaccessible.</p>

                                <p>collaborated with murmur's CEO, Brand Designer, and Customer Success Representative to finalize murmur's content framework. with four different buckets of content, i wanted to create to adhere to a healthy mix of product education, team interests, and future of work topics. i included a bucket called "conversations" to cross-post any interviews or articles related to the murmur-sphere.</p>

                <p>over the course of my career, i've had the pleasure of working with influential figures in the design sphere like Lovers Magazine (now: Spaces), and tech startups like Murmur (now: Plumb) and Contra: leading a series of content and brand initiatives, design projects, and UX experiences.</p>
                <p>leading with my love for community as a first generation cambodian-american, one of my goals in the workplace is to break the societal stigmas that were subconsciously placed upon women and BIPOC.</p>
                <p>in my free time, i love to take photos (ask me about my photography stack lol), experiment with my fashion, drink matcha lattes, and swoon over my current kpop biases.</p>
